## Comissioning on LSST
On this repository, I'll store my python scripts and Jupyter notebooks concerning my work on LSST Cameras comissioning.
My contribution is to validate the DM calibration products by comparing different collections together.
It will be divided in several parts such as
 * First part concerns AuxTel comissioning with :
	- First visualisation of defects collection and comparison to maskPlane on images post-ISR for differents images
	- Comparison of different defects collections 
	- ...
 * Second part will commme then concerns ComCam which will be mounted on the telescope, It will look like the first part
